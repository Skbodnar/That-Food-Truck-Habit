"That Food Truck Habit"

This is a simple webpage that displays various food trucks in San Francisco. 
When the User clicks on a map marker, basic information about that given food truck is dynamically displayed via a popup.

Technologies I used include: JavaScript, React and Leaflet.

To run this on your machine:
- clone the repository
- npm init -y
- npm install
- npm start

A challenge that I ran into was displaying a title on top of the map. 
This stackoverflow thread was a huge help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68305833/how-to-overlay-a-div-on-a-react-leaflet-map

Future Features I would like to implement include: a more stylized icon for the markers (a mini food truck perhaps!). 
I would also like to learn how to pull from all of this data: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data
For this iteration, I manually input select details for a handful of trucks into a json file.
